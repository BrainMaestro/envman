> Manage your `.env` configuration easily.

This package makes it easy to keep your `.env` in sync with the rest of your team without too much hassle. It allows you to break up your huge monolithic `.env.example` file into smaller files that have related variables. It also offers an easy and painless way of protecting sensitive configurations with encryption from [php-encryption](https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption).

This works in conjunction with any tool you use to actually load the `.env` values into your code like [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)

## Install

composer require --dev brainmaestro/envman
